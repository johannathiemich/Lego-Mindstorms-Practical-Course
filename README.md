# Lego-Mindstorms-Practical-Course

Result of the practical course "Lego Mindstorms" which I completed during the Wintersemster 2017/18 at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. 
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drv2-lLEoBc) shows, how the robot that we developed and programmed (in  a 3 person team) completes the course (video taken at final 
run before final competition; the robot did make some mistakes). 

The obstacle course consists of following a line with gaps, find its way through a line maze, crossing a bridge which includes driving a curve and finding 2 colored squares 
in a rectangular area. The sensors we used were a color sensor, a touch sensor and an ultrasonic sensor.

Our robot reached the 3rd place among all robots that were developed by the course participants in the final competition.
